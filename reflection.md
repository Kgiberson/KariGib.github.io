**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I learned that padding is best used to create more (or less) space between content and it's border, and margin is important for creating space between sections of the page and between elements in the same box.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I learned that you can use absolute positioning to attach the footer to the bottom of the page, default positioning is static, relative positioning is moved relative to where the elements original (static) positioning was, and fixed maintains an element's position on the top or side of the page even when scrolling.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Choosing fonts and a background was the easiest for me. The most difficult part was figuring out how to properly align my aside images & caption on my blog/index file. I enjoyed scouring the stackoverflow resources to find strategies for formatting effectively.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned that in many cases there is more than one way to accomplish a formatting goal. I learned how to import a google fonts stylesheet, select hexadecimal colors, create a horizontal navigation bar, set the html background to an image, create 2 columns by floating sections left and right, and how to create rounded borders.
