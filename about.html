      <p>Hello there, if you're reading this you've somehow stumbled upon my (WIP) about me page, which is about me, Kari. I was born and raised in Staten Island, NY (known for its guidos and the best pizza in the world) and made the jump over to the west coast for college. I graduated from Stanford University with a BA in Human Biology in 2013 and moved to Denver, CO to figure out what was next for me. I spent a year and a half working in several food-related positions (server, farm intern, sales ambassador for a pickle company!) and exploring the Rocky Mountains. I moved back to the Bay Area to work for a sustainable-food metric startup, but when funding fell through I re-evaluated my interests and decided to pursue coding. Hence my enrollment in DBC and this website!</p>
      <p>Quirky fact: The thing I'm most afraid of in the world is...mold. I just don't understand it.</p>
