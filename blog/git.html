        Just a couple of days ago, the term “version control” meant nothing more than its most basic definition - controlling or keeping track of different versions of a document, git was just a quicker way of saying GitHub, and GitHub was a website full of terms I didn’t understand that my coding friends would name-drop when geeking out. After a full day of research and command line coding challenges, I’ve begun to understand the importance of version control in the coding world.

        We’ve all found ourselves working on a team project at some point in our lives. I can remember the difficulty I faced trying to coordinating edits to a group research paper through email, constantly sharing documents back and forth. Now imagine if you were a web developer, working on a team and writing code to build a website. The chances of overwriting someone else’s changes or working from the wrong version are pretty darn high.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where git comes in. Git is a version control software that can be installed on your computer.  With the implementation of git, everyone on the team can work on any file at any time. Git tracks changes and allows its users to merge all the changes to a common version. Another benefit of git for web developers is it’s ability to efficiently and effectively store versions of code with the option of restoring previous versions if you mess up on a new edit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git helps keep track of changes by treating your history as a tree of changes. You can create your working tree by starting your own project or cloning an existing repository (from GitHub) to your computer. Tracking branches get their content from “git clone” and can be modified by users. Changes to the branch can be saved with the “git add .” and “git commit” commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git and GitHub are not the same thing. GitHub is a place to remotely store working directories and share your own repo’s publicly or with a team. Web developers use GitHub because it’s an excellent collaboration tool, allowing you to push, pull and merge repositories.
