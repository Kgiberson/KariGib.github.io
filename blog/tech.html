      <h3>What is Rails?</h3>
      <p>Created by David Hansson in 2004, Rails is an opinionated web application development framework, written in Ruby.
      Ruby as a standalone language is not designed for use on the Web. Enter Rails. Rails provides all the fancy scaffolding and materials needed to write a Ruby application and have it be a website.</p>
      <p>Rails streamlines the process of making web applications by making assumptions about what developers need to get started with their app. While there might be multiple ways to accomplish a goal in Rails, the software assumes that there is a "best" way, aka "the Rails way."</p>
      <h3>What are the guiding principles of Rails?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><p><span class="thick">Don't Repeat Yourself</span> (DRY) - means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place.</p>
          <li><p><span class="thick">Convention over Configuration (CoC)</span> - which means that a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application, leading to less code and less repitition.</p>
      <h3>Why learn Ruby on Rails?</h3>
      <p>It's elegant and awesome. Designed with the best practices in mind, Rails guides you into writing awesome code. Rails is also great for rapid prototyping, which makes it popular amongst tech startups.</p>
      <p>Rails is great for beginners, because Ruby is great for beginners. It's a powerful tool that does most of the hardwork for you.</p>
