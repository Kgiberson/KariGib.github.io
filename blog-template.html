        Just a couple of days ago, the term “version control” meant nothing more than its most basic definition - controlling or keeping track of different versions of a document, git was just a quicker way of saying GitHub, and GitHub was a website full of terms I didn’t understand that my coding friends would name-drop when geeking out. After a full day of research and command line coding challenges, I’ve begun to understand the importance of version control in the coding world.

- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Wireframing in a pair was helpful. We were able to talk through the organization of the page together and discussed different options for layouts.
- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Definitely, and I really enjoyed using moqups to create the wireframes.
- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Clear and creative organization.
- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
